ADP = Average Draft Position
ADP is used to compared players between positions 

Example:
Reily Obrien (RUC) adp = 24
Darcy Parish (FWD) adp = 23

This means Obrien is projected to be 24 points better than a replacment level RUC, and Parish 23 points better than a replacment level FWD. Therefore we can compare using positions who may be a better pick in the draft at that stage.

This helps prevents selecting all mids, and then being left will all low level players in other positions.
